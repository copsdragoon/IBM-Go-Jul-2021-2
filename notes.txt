Golang
    Why?
    What is unique about Go?
        fast
        concurrency
        garbage collection

        compiled
        No VM (close to hardware)
        Memory management is taken care (by the garbage collector)

    Simplicity
        - No classes
        - No inheritance (ONLY composition)
        - No access modifiers
        - No exceptions (ONLY errors)

        - 25 keywords
            var, func, import, package, if, switch, for, fallthrough, continue, chan, go, select, range, make, new

    Built for concurrency
        - goroutines
        - 1000s of goroutines can be executed in one OS thread
        - scheduler is builtin in the runtime
        - language features for concurrency
            go, chan, select, range

    Close to hardware
